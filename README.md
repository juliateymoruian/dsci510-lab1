Lab #1: 
My lab1 file contains a function that prints the statment "Welcome to DSCI 510!". This was achieved by creating a function for the print command named "classwelcome()". This function was defined by using the print command and putting the desired phrase inside of parentheses and then quotations so the print command could identify the words as strings. 

To invoke lab1.py the first step is to download the file onto your computer. The file downloaded will be a plain text file containing the Python code. Move the file “lab1.py” into a folder on your Desktop and open a command-line using your terminal. In your terminal, you will use the files’ path to open lab1.py. To do this, navigate to your Desktop (use the command “cd Desktop” if on a Mac) and then navigate to the folder that contains the lab1.py file using the “cd” command. To run the file, call for the file from the terminal. An example of this call could be “$ python lab1.py”. If the file’s Python script is correct, after pressing Enter, the phrase “Welcome to DSCI 550!” should appear and the Python script should be successfully run.
