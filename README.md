Lab #1: 
My lab1 file contains a function that prints the statment "Welcome to DSCI 510!". This was achieved by creating a function for the print command named "classwelcome()". This function was defined by using the print command and putting the desired phrase inside of parentheses and then quotations so the print command could identify the words as strings. 

To invoke lab1.py the first step is to download the file onto your computer. The file downloaded will be a plain text file containing the Python code. To run the Python script file, open a command-line and type in the word python followed by the path to your lab1.py file. An example could be “$ python lab1.py”. If the file’s script is correct, after pressing Enter, the phrase “Welcome to DSCI 510!” should appear and the Python script should be successfully run.
