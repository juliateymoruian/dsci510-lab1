# dsci510-lab1

Lab #1: 
My lab1 file contains a function that prints the statment "Welcome to DSCI 510!". This was achieved by creating a function for the print command named "classwelcome()". This function was defined by using the print command and putting the desired phrase inside of parentheses and then quotations so the print command could identify the words as strings. 

To invoke the classwelcome() function found in lab1.py in a different Python file the function can be imported. This can be achieved by calling the function by typing "from lab1 import classwelcome" and then by calling "classwelcome()". When called the function will print the satement "Welcome to DSCI510!".
